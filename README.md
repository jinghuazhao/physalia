# physalia

A template for a newly created repository. It was named while the Physalia course, [GWAS-course](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/GWAS-course), in preparation.

 **File** | **Description**
 -----|------------------------------------
 .gitconfig | $HOME/.gitconfig due to setup.sh
 .gitignore | files not synchronised with GitHub
 README.md | this file
 setup.sh | setup for a standard repository
 ssh.sh | setup for SSH
 st.sh | automatic push

NB .gitconfig functions like ssh in the sense that login with username/password is rarely necessary.
